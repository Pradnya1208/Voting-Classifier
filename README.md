## Objective:
To predict survival on the Titanic and get familiar with ML basics.<br>
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this problem, we have done the complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we applied the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
## Dataset:
[Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

#### Data Fields:
| Variable              | Definition                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Survival |  Survival|
| pclass |  Ticket Class|
| sex |  Sex|
| Age |  Age in years|
| sibsp |  number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic|
| parch |  number of parents/children aboardthe Titanic|
| ticket | Ticket number|
| fare |  Passenger fare|
| cabin |  Cabin Number|
| embarked |  Port of Embarkation|

#### Variable Notes:
- **pclass**: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

- **age**: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

- **sibsp**: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
- **Sibling** = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
- **Spouse** = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)

- **parch**: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
- **Parent** = mother, father
- **Child** = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
